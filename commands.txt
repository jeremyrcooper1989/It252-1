1) first i used git pull to make sure that i had the most up to date master.
2) then i used nano nameoffile.txt to write the text and create the file.
3) then i used git add --all to stage all of the files.
4) The next part im not sure if i did correctly but i did git commit -m and it opened a nano then you just remove the # signs for the files that you want to add.
5)The final stage is to use the git push command to re upload the files to the github website.
